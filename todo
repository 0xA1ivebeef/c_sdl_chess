TODO:

king squares are not updated, castle rights are not removed when king moves

if rook is captured, cant castle anymore
just like rook or king having moved

apply moves and filter moves have sideeffects
remove castle rights is callled

PRIO:
-> enpassant squares are not set
-> castle rights are deleted

normal:
-> does king square update work properly? since it is embedded into apply move

optional:
->
